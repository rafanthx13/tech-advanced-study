### Subqueries → CTEs

That last example shown above can also be used for this swap! If you look above, we start with a subquery within a query and then finish by using CTEs.
What exactly is a CTE? CTE stands for common table expression. It creates a temporary set of results that you can use in your proceeding queries. It requires that you start it with WITH and use table_name AS before each individual CTE. Your last CTE in the sequence should be a simple SELECT statement without a table_name nor AS.

````sql
WITH 
money_summed AS (
   SELECT 
      customer_id,
      date,
      SUM(balance) AS balance,
      SUM(debt) AS debt
   FROM bank_balance 
   GROUP BY customer_id, date
),
money_available_calculated AS (
   SELECT 
      customer_id,
      date,
      (balance - debt) AS money_available 
   FROM money_summed 
   GROUP BY customer_id, date
)
SELECT
   customer_id,
   money_available 
FROM money_available_calculated 
WHERE date = '2022-01-01'
